## 🎯 Recommended Order

1. **Set up Roblox Studio** (follow `ROBOX_STUDIO_SETUP.md`)
2. **Create folders** (use `FOLDER_STRUCTURE_CHECKLIST.md`)
3. **Start Rojo** (fix plugin error first)
4. **Use Cursor T1** to generate folder structure
5. **Use Cursor T2-T16** to build systems
6. **Address TODOs** as you implement

## 📝 Optional: Clean Up Later

**After setup, you can:**
- Commit documentation files to git
- Clean up duplicate folders
- Complete scaffolded systems
- Address TODO comments

**But none of this blocks starting!**
