# 🆕 Create New Place with Fresh Name

## 🎯 New Project Name

To avoid confusion with "spacecats", let's use a **completely different name**:

**New Place Name:** `CosmoCats_NebulaRealms`

This is clearly different from "spacecats" and matches your game's theme!

## 📝 Step-by-Step: Create New Place

### Step 1: Close Current Place
1. **File** → **Close** (or close the tab)
2. Make sure you're not in the old spacecats place

### Step 2: Create Fresh Baseplate
1. **File** → **New**
2. Select **"Baseplate"** template
3. This creates a completely fresh, empty place

### Step 3: Save with New Name
1. **File** → **Save As**
2. Navigate to: `/Users/allanschenkel/Documents/Roblox Projects/CosmoCat/studio-project/`
3. **Name:** `CosmoCats_NebulaRealms`
4. Click **Save**

### Step 4: Verify It's the New Place
- **Title bar** should say: "CosmoCats_NebulaRealms"
- **Explorer** should be mostly empty (just baseplate)
- **NOT** linked to spacecats game

## 🔄 Update Rojo Configuration (Optional)

If you want to keep the Rojo project name consistent, you can update it, but it's not required. The place file name and Rojo project name can be different.

## ✅ After Creating New Place

1. **Reconnect Rojo:**
   - Make sure Rojo is connected (port 34872)
   - Files should sync to the new place

2. **Re-run Lighting Setup:**
   - Use the fixed LightingSetup script (or set manually)

3. **Verify:**
   - Click **Play** - should NOT show "spacecats"
   - Should be a fresh, empty place

## 🎯 Recommended File Structure

**New place file:**
```
studio-project/
├── CosmoCats_NebulaRealms.rbxl  ← New place file
├── default.project.json          ← Rojo config (unchanged)
├── rojo.project.json             ← Rojo config (unchanged)
└── src/                          ← Source code (unchanged)
```
