## ⭐ 1. DESIGN PRINCIPLES

Your monetization system must follow these rules:

### 1.1 Core Ethical Rules

- ✔ **No pay-to-win** - No faster XP, no exclusive power
- ✔ **No loot boxes** - No gambling mechanics
- ✔ **No paywalls that block core content** - Base species & map are free
- ✔ **Everything earned is cosmetic-only** - Looks, not abilities
- ✔ **All paid items can be earned for free over time** - Prestige or Stardust equivalents
- ✔ **Paid purchases feel premium, polished, elegant** - VFX, particles, auras
- ✔ **No pressure, no spam** - No pop-ups, no FOMO timers
- ✔ **Kids can enjoy 100% of the game for free** - And actually feel happy!

### 1.2 Cosmo Cats Monetization Philosophy

**This is how the top RP games retain millions of players.**

Cosmo Cats is built on:
- **Aesthetic** - Visual beauty
- **Identity** - Self-expression
- **Expression** - Personalization

**NOT power.**

So monetization taps into the things players love to personalize:
- Species
- Effects
- Patterns
- Colors
- Accessories
- Beds
- Emotes
- Auras
- Titles
- Pets / side spirits

**Everything MUST feel optional.**

### 1.3 Target Audience Alignment

Cosmo Cats monetization is perfectly aligned with:
- **RP players** - Kids, teens, creatives
- **Identity-focused players** - Want to express themselves
- **Community builders** - Clans, groups, friends
- **Aesthetic lovers** - Beautiful visuals matter

**No competitive pressure.**
**No power advantage.**
**Just beautiful self-expression.**
